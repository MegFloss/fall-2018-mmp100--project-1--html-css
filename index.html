 <p>Born the son of an entrepreneur in O'Fallon Illinois, William Franklin Beedle better
   known as William Holden, was in many respects more of a business man and global philanthropist
   than a movie star.  According to friends and others who knew him personally, he would have rather been known for
   a legacy of innovative thinking in medicine or science.  Determined to do the best
   at whatever his endeavor, Bill Beedle set a life time standard for integrity
   success and hard work.
</p><div>The 1950 classic  Sunset Blvd. starring Bill Holden Gloria Swanson
  was a true and honest story about the popular culture of Hollywood.
  Nearly all the actors in the film portrayed snippets of their authentic life story.
  Swanson having been a washed up film star from the "silent movie era"and Holden
  instead of being a struggling script writer was at the time a struggling actor
  having difficulty  finding good paying and respectful roles that is until he found
  the blockbuster film noir in Sunset Blvd.</div><div><p>
  In 1939 Holden made his movie debut with Golden Boy.  He would eventually star in some of the most popular and critically
  acclaimed films of all time including such blockbusters such as:
  <ul>
  <li>Sunset Boulevard
  <li>The Wild Bunch
  <li>Picnic
  <li>The Towering Inferno
  <li>Network
  </ul>
