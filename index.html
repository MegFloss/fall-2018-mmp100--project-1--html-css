     <p>Hannah Arendt was born in Hanover, Germany. Arendt is a twentieth century political philosopher.
       Totalitarianism, revolution, the nature of freedom, and the faculties of thought and judgment are
       the subjects of her several books and numerous scholarly writings.</p>

     <p>In Arendt’s book, Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil (1963). She wrote that
       Eichmann was “terrifyingly normal, not an amoral monster,”. Instead, he “performed evil deeds
       without evil intentions, a fact connected to his ‘thoughtlessness”, a “disengagement from the reality
       of his evil acts.” Eichmann “never realised what he was doing, due to an inability to think from the
       standpoint of somebody else.” Without a “cognitive ability”, he “committed crimes under circumstances
       that made it well-nigh impossible for him to know or to feel that he was doing wrong”. Arendt called
       these “collective characteristics of Eichmann, ‘the banality of evil’: he was “not inherently evil,
       but merely shallow and clueless, a ‘joiner’.”</p>
