      Elon Musk is many things. He is a CEO and founder of two of the most
      revolutionary companies in the modern world, Tesla and SpaceX. He is
      a genius engineer, constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible
      in Science and Technology. And he is a true visionary, foreseeing worlds
      others cannot even imagine.

      Elon came from Pretoria, South Africa and was coding since the young ripe
      age of 10 years old. He than made his way to Canada as a teen and than came
      to the United States to finish college.

      He than became an extremely successful entrepreneur starting many web
      companies during a time when the internet was still in its infancy. This
      made him very rich and allowed him to pursue his visions for humanity,
      starting Tesla, a company meant to bring us into an electric car future,
      and SpaceX, a company meant to bring us to mars and beyond.

      Elon's mission, work ethic, and drive are so impressive to me. As an
      aspiring engineer and entrepreneur myself, he is a true inspiration to me!
      There are very few people on this planet like Elon and I hope that I can
      acomplish even a small part of what he was able to.
