  <h1>Elon Musk - Engineer, Leader and Visionary</h1>
  <p>
      Elon Musk is many things. He is a CEO and founder of two of the most
      revolutionary companies in the modern world, Tesla and SpaceX. He is
      a genius engineer, constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible
      in Science and Technology. And he is a true visionary, foreseeing worlds
      others cannot even imagine.<br/>
      Elon came from Pretoria, South Africa and was coding since the young ripe
      age of 10 years old. He than made his way to Canada as a teen and than came
      to the United States to finish college.<br/>
      He than became an extremely successful entrepreneur starting many web
      companies during a time when the internet was still in its infancy. This
      made him very rich and allowed him to pursue his visions for humanity,
      starting Tesla, a company meant to bring us into an electric car future,
      and SpaceX, a company meant to bring us to mars and beyond.<br/>
      Elon's mission, work ethic, and drive are so impressive to me. As an
      aspiring engineer and entrepreneur myself, he is a true inspiration to me!
      There are very few people on this planet like Elon and I hope that I can
      acomplish even a small part of what he was able to.
