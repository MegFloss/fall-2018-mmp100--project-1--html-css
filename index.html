<h2>
<p>Frank Ocean is a very influential person in my life. His music helped me through many dark times in my life, whether its from issues with familial ties or heartbreak his music was always there. Frank Ocean's vocals and aesthetics are something that most people can enjoy. Growing up I would always listen to music and when I found out about Odd Future (old rap group that Frank was a part of) I started to skate and draw and get into fashion. Frank Ocean was the one out of the group that didnt use provacative or aggressive lyrics and that's what drew me in. Seeing that Frank was the most humble true to himself gave me some sort of guidance and showed me that its ok to be yourself even if you dont fit in.</p>

<p>Frank Ocean released an album in 2012 called Channel Orange. He then went ghost to focus on himself leaving the world shocked as to where he went. 4 years later he then releases "Blond" this album only had one single called "Nikes" essentially talking about people that starve for money with lines like "they looking for check" hence the wordplay on Nike. </p>
