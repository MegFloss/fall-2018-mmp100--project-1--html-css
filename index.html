<h1>Lindsey Stirling <h1>

 <body> <font size="4"><P ALIGN=LEFT> Lindsey Stirling is a professional violinist that also dances while playing at the same time. She has done pop, rock, and classical styles of music. Lindsey Stirling was living in Gilbert, Arizona. She is the middle child of 2 sisters of Diane and Stephen Stirling. Lindsey Stirling parents could only financially afford half violin lessons. Starting from the age of 5 years old Lindsey was learning how to play the violin. Lindsey attended Mesquite High School and during that time was in a band called the Stomp on Melvin. In the Stomp the Melvin band she did write a solo song which helped her win a state title called the Arizona’s Junior Miss. Lindsey got the Spirit Awards at the America’s Junior Miss. She also was in the Jenkins Band for around a year before she left the band. I like the way Lindsey Stirling music is relaxing and dancing upbeat style. I enjoy the way she uses magical fantasy and other game themes into her music. I am a fan of her work and I follow her on YouTube to watch her video’s and listen to her music. Lindsey Stirling has done music video’s such has Pokémon Dubstep Remix, Zelda Medley, and the Halo Theme which are all games I enjoy playing has even still today. Lindsey Stirling style of music is so wonderful and enjoyable to listen too which is why I am a fan of her creative work. I follow her on YouTube since she updates list of videos all the time.
