 <p>Born the son of an entrepreneur in O'Fallon Illinois, William Franklin Beedle better
   known as William Holden, was in many respects more of a business man and global philanthropist
   than a movie star.  According to friends and others who knew him personally, he would have rather been known for
   a legacy of innovative thinking in medicine or science.  Determined to do the best
   at whatever his endeavor, Bill Beedle set a life time standard for integrity
   success and hard work.
</p><div>In 1939 Holden made his movie debut with Golden Boy.
  <p>In The 1950 Holden co starred with Gloria Swanson, Nancy Olsen
  and the TV show "Dragnet" famed actor, Jack Webb.  The movie "Sunset Blvd,
  directed by Billy Wilder, depicted a true and honest story about popular culture
  and the fictious life of Hollywood.  Nearly all the performers in the film portrayed
  snippets of their real life.  Gloria Swanson was once a famous film star from the silent
  era, having now a washed up career.  Holden potrayed a struggling script writer in the film, yet
  not quite struggling. In real life he was, at the time, having difficulty  finding roles he felt
  comfortable potraying. That is, until he found "it" in the blockbuster role of Joe Gillis
  and the noir film classic.  It remains popular to this day.
