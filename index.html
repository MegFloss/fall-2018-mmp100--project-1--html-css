        <p>Elliott Smith a Singer-Songwriter best known for such works as Miss Misery,
  Needle and Hay and Say Yes. Born in Omaha, NE on August 6, 1969, he lived in
  Texas till his teenage years when he moved to Portland, OR. He gain noteriety
  for his work Good Will Hunting's soundtrack, for which his song Miss Misery
  was nominated. Elliott had a rare ability to write compelling lyrics with
  harmonies that were complex, but kept a delicate tembre. Elliott Smith is
 interesting to me because because his songs feel like an endless labyrinth,
everytime you feel like you have him figured out you find another door.</p>
