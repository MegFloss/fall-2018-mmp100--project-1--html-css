<p> Marques K. Brownlee (born December 3, 1993), also known professionally as <strong>MKBHD</strong>, is an American YouTuber, best known for his technology-focused videos.
  The channel, whose name is a concatenation of MKB (Brownlee's initials) and HD (for high-definition),
   has over 6.9 million subscribers and over 1 billion total video views. In August 2013, Vic Gundotra, former Senior Vice President, Social for Google
   called Brownlee "the best technology reviewer on the planet right now.</p>



   <p> MKBHD joined YouTube on March 21, 2008.He first started uploading technology videos in January 2009, while still in high school, about new products or reviews of products he already owned.
     Brownlee's reviews have been promoted by other review sites as well. In December 2014, Brownlee started his Smartphone Award Series, where he picks the best phones in certain categories from the past year.
     In 2017, Brownlee created physical awards featured in the video, some of which were later requested and sent to the companies whose phones won them.

     Brownlee grew up in Maplewood, New Jersey. He attended Columbia High School and studied at the Howe School at Stevens Institute of Technology, where majored in business and information technology.
     Brownlee graduated from college in May 2015 and became a full-time YouTuber. His videos were produced at his apartment until he moved out in Spring 2016, and he now works
     out of a studio in Kearny, New Jersey, using RED video equipment.</p>
